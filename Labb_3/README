A mix of lab 1 and 2. It works exactly the same as lab 1 but it now has a backend where it will store everything
so nothing disappears when you refresh.

Run by starting mongoDB:
> sudo service mogod start
And running the app:
> node lib/ex.js
It will now run on localhost:3000
Tests can be run with nyc mocha test
